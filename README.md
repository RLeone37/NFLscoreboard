# Live NFL Scoreboard (Local Logos Version)

This version displays live NFL game data from ESPN while showing local team logos.

## Setup
1. Place your team logos inside the folder: **NFL logos/** (same directory as index.html).
2. Ensure each file name matches the team abbreviation, e.g. `BUF.png`, `DAL.png`.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the scoreboard.

If a local logo is missing, it automatically falls back to ESPN’s official logo URL.
