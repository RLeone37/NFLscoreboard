# NFL Live Scoreboard (Logos Version)

This version shows live, upcoming, and completed NFL games using local team logos.

## Setup
1. Place all team logos (PNG, SVG, or WEBP) in the **logos/** folder next to index.html.
   - Use UPPERCASE team abbreviations for file names (e.g., BUF.png, DAL.png, SF.png).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. If any logo is missing, the script automatically falls back to ESPN’s logo.
